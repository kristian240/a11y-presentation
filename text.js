## Motivation

Accessibility on the web developer is often a last thought and that needs to be changed

> About **15% of the population** lives with disability.

\`\`\`
15% of the population
  = 0.15 * 7 816 461 760
  = 1 172 469 264
  = 1,17 billion
\`\`\`

## Screen reader

### Apple's VoiceOver

VO toggle üëâüèª <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>F5</kbd>

VO key üëâüèº <kbd>Control</kbd> + <kbd>Option</kbd>

Navigation (next/previous) üëâüèΩ <kbd>VO key</kbd> + <kbd>Right/Left Arrow</kbd>

Navigation by headings üëâüèæ <kbd>VO key</kbd> + <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>H</kbd>

Help üëâüèø <kbd>VO key</kbd> + <kbd>H</kbd>

## Semantics

### What do we mean with semantics?

VS.

![Semantic button](images/button-button.png)

### Why to use it?

> 1. **Easier to develop with** ‚Äî you get some functionality for free plus it is arguably easier to understand.
2. **Better on mobile** ‚Äî semantic HTML is arguably lighter in file size than non-semantic spaghetti code, and easier to make responsive.
3. **Good for SEO** ‚Äî search engines give more importance to keywords inside headings, links, etc. than keywords included in non-semantic divs, etc., so your documents will be more findable by customers.

### Semantic elements

* header
* main
* footer
* nav
* aside
* section
* article

## Tab index

### What is tabindex?

> The \`tabindex\` global attribute indicates that its element can be focused,
and where it participates in sequential keyboard navigation (usually with the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key, hence the name).

## Focus ring

### What is focus ring?

> Focus ring is a visible outline (a ring) around the element that is currently in focus.

![No outline](images/focusring-remove.png)

### :focus-within

> The :focus-within CSS pseudo-class represents an element
that has received focus or contains an element that has received focus.
In other words, it represents an element that is itself matched by the :focus pseudo-class
or has a descendant that is matched by :focus.

*It has no Internet Explorer support* üò¨ *but there are polyfills*

### Example

<iframe height="300" style="width: 100%;" scrolling="no" title="BazoNaa" src="https://codepen.io/kristian240/embed/BazoNaa?height=265&theme-id=light&default-tab=result" frameborder="no" loading="lazy" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true">

## ARIA attributes

### What is ARIA?

> Accessible Rich Internet Application

* role (role)
* aria-checked (state)
* aria-label (property)
* ...

The difference between properties and states is that the value of the property is less likley to change
but the value of the states is expected to change. 

ARIA attibutes are really powerfull as they can:
* help us style the element depenting of the state (has error, is disabled, ...) and impove site performace
* imporve accessibillity our elements and the page

![Error-able element without aria](images/error-able-element-no-aria.png)

VS.

![Error-able element with aria](images/error-able-element-with-aria.png)

### No ARIA is better than bad ARIA

> Functionally, ARIA roles, states, and properties are analogous to a CSS for assistive technologies.
For screen reader users, ARIA controls the rendering of their non-visual experience.
Incorrect ARIA misrepresents visual experiences,
with potentially devastating effects on their corresponding non-visual experiences.

### aria-current VS aria-selected

**aria-current** usually accepts these values:
* page - usually used in navigation
* location - usually used in breadcrumbs
* date/time - usually used in date picker element
* step - usually used in step components
* boolean

**aria-selected** is a boolean only state

**Example 1** - Navigation

**Example 2** - Date picker

## Labels

There are few ways to label an elemenet (usually some user interactive element like text input, button, ...)

## Alerts

### aria live region

To make part of a page alert you simply set role attribute to alert

![Aria alert](images/alert.png)

Aria live-region takes the focus to the region that is specified to be a live region.
This way we tell the screen reader: *"Hey, this will be dynamically updated!"*

### aria-live

There are three *politness settings*

* off - will not change current focus (default)
* polite - will wait for the end of current reading
* assertive - will become in focus immediately

### aria-atomic

If set to true the entire content of the element will be presented.

### aria-controls

Set of the controls that will update the aria-live content

### exmples

* [Using role alert #1](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/examples/alert/alert.html)

* [Using role alert #2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Live_Regions#Dropdown_box_updates_useful_onscreen_information)

## Headings & landmarks

Usually a first thing users do is to scan a page via headings and landmarks

### Headings

As a developer you want to follow and implement headings levels one by one.

**Please,** do not skip heading levels since that is wrong on so many levels.

### Landmarks

Also, one way to navigate the site is to follow the landmarks. For example,
this way the user can immediatlly jump to *main* part of the page
in order to skip the navigation and other non changing parts of the page

## Modals

First, lets go check what is expected behaviour on [ARIA authoring practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#dialog_modal).
